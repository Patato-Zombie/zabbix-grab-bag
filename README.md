zabbix-grab-bag
===============

This is a collection of miscellaneous scripts for Zabbix data collection, maintenance, etc.

I will endeavor to keep them categorized by directory and well documented, but some have been around for a while and may not be well documented yet.

These are made available by me under an Apache 2.0 license, except where specifically licensed under some other license.

If you have something useful to add here, or awesome code changes, I will accept pull requests.

The format of the directories/files should be:
scriptname(.sh|.py|.pl|.whatever) scriptname.userparm scriptname_template.xml scriptname_readme.md

I haven't completed this for all of my scripts yet, but this is the general idea.

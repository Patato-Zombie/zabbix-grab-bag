The nutups script/template is designed to collect metrics from NUT (htt://www.networkupstools.org/)
and store them in Zabbix.  This design is extensible.  You can add more statistics as needed.
This is by design as not all UPSes have the same keys.  The statistics I added to the template should
be a good starting point.  Most UPSes should have those.

You can add your own value mappings, as those are not yet exportable in templates.  You can see 
the value mapping tables in the nutups.sh script itself.
